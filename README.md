# Project Title and Description
## Title
The Influence of Urban Infrastructure on House Prices in the City of Ilhéus
## Description
The relationship between urban infrastructure and house prices is a topic of growing interest to urban planners, real estate investors, and potential property buyers. In the city of Ilhéus, known for its natural beauty and historical significance in the state of Bahia, this dynamic is particularly evident. This study aims to explore how different aspects of urban infrastructure - such as accessibility, quality of public roads, availability of essential services, and leisure areas - influence house prices in the area.
# Objectives
## General objectives
Develop an algorithm capable of capturing real estate data from the city of Ilhéus from the website OLX.com so that it can serve as a basis for my course completion project.
Furthermore, it will help my future fellow economists to use this algorithm to build their course completion project.
## Specific objectives
- Map the main urban infrastructure works in Ilhéus
- Evaluate the variation in real estate prices between neighborhoods and areas of the city.
- Examine the relationship between specific infrastructure improvements and real estate appreciation.
